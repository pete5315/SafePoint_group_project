# SafePoint


Creation of this application was under the creative guidance and idea from Zach Lulavy
### Programmers:
Conrad Rolf,
Steven Petersen,
Touathi Vang, and
Maxwell Chrysler




## Purpose:


SafePoint is a web application (optimized for mobile use) meant to provide a quicker alternative for getting help at events such as concerts. Users register an account prior to attendance, and then when the time comes to reach out for help users select the event they are currently at.


### Installation Process


Required installation 
Node.js [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)


Create a database named `safepoint`.
Copy and paste code found in `database.sql` into PostgreSQL/Postico the tables, and dummy data if you'd like.


The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on PostgreSQL, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an ` npm install`


Run `npm run server` in your terminal


Run `npm run client` in your terminal


The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!




# Usage of Safepoint
